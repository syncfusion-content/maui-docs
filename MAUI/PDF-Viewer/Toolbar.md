# Working with Toolbar in .NET MAUI Pdf Viewer (SfPdfViewer)

The [SfPdfViewer](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.PdfViewer.SfPdfViewer.html) has a built-in toolbar, which allows you to perform operations such as adding, modifying annotations, searching text, etc. Additionally, you have the option to show or hide the default built-in toolbar, its sub-toolbars, and toolbar items. You can customize your own toolbar by disabling the built-in toolbar, then implementing one in the application and integrating the custom toolbar UI into the PDF viewer APIs. You can see the custom toolbar example [here](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/maui-pdf-viewer-examples/tree/master/Custom%20Toolbar).

## Show/hide the toolbar

By default, the built-in toolbar is visible. You can `hide` it by setting the `ShowToolbars` property of the PDF Viewer to `false`. And you can `show` the built-in toolbar by setting the `ShowToolbars` property of the PDF Viewer to `true`.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# %}
//set the ShowToolbars to false
public MainPage()
{
     SfPdfViewer pdfViewer=new SfPdfViewer();
     pdfViewer.ShowToolbars = false;
}  
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight XAML %}
 <ContentPage.Content>

  <syncfusion:SfPdfViewer x:Name="pdfViewer" DocumentSource ="{Binding PdfDocumentStream} " ShowToolbars="False" />

  </ContentPage.Content>
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Customize the toolbar 

To customize the toolbar, you can programmatically add, remove, and hide the items based on your needs.

### Customizing toolbar items using the GetByName method

**Accessing and modifying the visibility of the toolbar items**

By using the `GetByName` method with its specified toolbar or icon names, you can access the properties of those toolbars or items. After accessing the item, you can modify its visibility by setting the `IsVisible` property. Here, we retrieve the toolbar "PrimaryToolbar" and "Search" item using the GetByName method and hide the "Search" item by setting its visibility to false.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# %}
// On the desktop, we access the search button located in the primary toolbar using the GetByName method.

var item = pdfViewer.Toolbars?.GetByName("PrimaryToolbar")?.Items?.GetByName("Search");
if (item != null)
{
item.IsVisible = false; // Hide the search item
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

**Adding a new toolbar item**

To add an item to the toolbar in [SfPdfViewer](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.PdfViewer.SfPdfViewer.html), first, create the UI element you want to include. Then, convert that element into a ToolbarItem using the `ToolbarItem` method. Finally, add the newly created ToolbarItem to the toolbar using the `Add` method. Here we create the new button fileOpenButton and retrieve the "PrimaryToolbar" using the GetByName method. Add the new button to the "Primary Toolbar".

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# %}
//Create a button you want to add.

Button fileOpenButton = new Button
 {
     Text = "\ue712",           
     FontSize = 24,
     IsEnabled = false,
     FontFamily = "Maui Material Assets",
     HorizontalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center,
     VerticalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center,
     BackgroundColor = Colors.Transparent,
     BorderColor = Colors.Transparent,
     Padding = 10,
     Margin = new Thickness(5, 0, 0, 0),
     Opacity = 0.5 
 };
//We access the PrimaryToolbar on the desktop using the GetByName method and add the item you created in it.

pdfViewer.Toolbars?.GetByName("PrimaryToolbar")?.Items?.Add(new Syncfusion.Maui.PdfViewer.ToolbarItem(fileOpenButton, "FileOpenButton"));
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

**Adding a new toolbar item at a specific index**

To add an item at a specific index in the toolbar in [SfPdfViewer](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.PdfViewer.SfPdfViewer.html), first create the UI element you want to include. Then, convert that element into a ToolbarItem using the `ToolbarItem` method. Finally, add the newly created ToolbarItem to the toolbar using the `Insert` method. Use the `Index` property to get the index of the item you want to add after, and insert the new item at a specific index. Here we create the button fileSaveButton and retrieve the index of the "Print" button in the "PrimaryToolbar". The new button is inserted into the toolbar right after the "Print" button.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# %}
//Create a button you want to add.

Button fileSaveButton = new Button
 {
     Text = "\ue75f",           
     FontSize = 24,
     FontFamily = "Maui Material Assets",
     HorizontalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center,
     VerticalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center,
     BackgroundColor = Colors.Transparent,
     BorderColor = Colors.Transparent,
     IsEnabled = false,
     Opacity = 0.5,
     Padding = 10
 };
//We access the PrimaryToolbar on the desktop using the GetByName method and get the item index using Index property.

var index = (int)pdfViewer?.Toolbars?.GetByName("PrimaryToolbar ")?.Items?.GetByName("Print")?.Index;

// We accessed the PrimaryToolbar on the desktop using the GetByName method and inserted the item after the last item index.

pdfViewer.Toolbars?.GetByName("PrimaryToolbar")?.Items?.Insert(index+1, new Syncfusion.Maui.PdfViewer.ToolbarItem(fileSaveButton, "FileSaveButton"));
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

**Removing an item from the toolbar**

To remove an item from the toolbar in [SfPdfViewer](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.PdfViewer.SfPdfViewer.html), you can access the specific item using the `GetByName` method and then remove it from the toolbar's item collection using the `Remove` method. Here we retrieve the "Outline" item from the "PrimaryToolbar" using the GetByName method. If the item is found, it is removed from the toolbar.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# %}
//We access the outline item in the PrimaryToolbar on the desktop using the GetByName method and remove it.

 var item = pdfViewer.Toolbars?.GetByName("PrimaryToolbar")?.Items?.GetByName("Outline");
 if (item != null)
 {
     pdfViewer.Toolbars?.GetByName("PrimaryToolbar")?.Items?.Remove(item); // Remove the outline item
 }
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

Similarly, you can customize the other toolbars and their items by accessing their names. We have listed the other toolbar and toolbar item names below:

# Right to left in .NET MAUI PDF Viewer (SfPdfViewer)

By default, the [SfPdfViewer](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.PdfViewer.SfPdfViewer.html) control laid out in the left-to-right flow direction. For the convenience of right-to-left language users, it enables changing the flow direction to right-to-left (RTL). This can be achieved by setting the [FlowDirection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.maui.iview.flowdirection?view=net-maui-7.0) property to `RightToLeft`. 
Setting the `FlowDirection` property to `RightToLeft` on the SfPdfViewer sets the alignment to the right, and layouts the built-in controls used in the SfPdfViewer to flow from right-to-left. Refer to the following code example to apply the same.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight XAML %}

        <syncfusion:SfPdfViewer
            x:Name="PdfViewer"
            FlowDirection="RightToLeft"/>

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight C# %}

        PdfViewer.FlowDirection = FlowDirection.RightToLeft;

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

# Events in .NET MAUI Picker (SfPicker)

Three events have been used for a [.NET MAUI Picker](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-picker) when it is in the Dialog mode. They are, 

 * Opened 
 * Closing 
 * Closed
 * SelectionChanged
 * OkButtonClicked
 * CancelButtonClicked

## Opened

The [Opened](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Picker.PickerBase.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Picker_PickerBase_Opened) event occurs when the picker pop-up is opened.

## Closing event

The [Closing](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Picker.PickerBase.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Picker_PickerBase_Closing) event is raised when the picker pop-up is closing. Prevent the picker pop-up from closing by setting "e.cancel" to true.

## Closed event

The [Closed](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Picker.PickerBase.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Picker_PickerBase_Closed) event is raised after the picker pop-up is closed.

## SelectionChanged Event
The [SelectionChanged](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Picker.SfPicker.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Picker_SfPicker_SelectionChanged) is raised after the selected index changed on the `SfPicker`.

## OkButtonClicked Event

The [OkButtonClicked](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Picker.PickerBase.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Picker_PickerBase_OkButtonClicked) event is raised after the `ok` button clicked on the `SfPicker`. This event is not applicable while the footer view and `ok` button are not visible.

## CancelButtonClicked Event

The [CancelButtonClicked](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Picker.PickerBase.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Picker_PickerBase_CancelButtonClicked) is raised after the `Cancel` button clicked on the `SfPicker`. This event is not applicable while the footer view is not visible.

# Events in .NET MAUI Picker (SfPicker)

Three events have been used for a picker when it is in the Dialog mode. They are, 

 * Opened 
 * Closing 
 * Closed

## Opened

The `Opened` event occurs when the picker pop-up is opened.

## Closing event

The "Closing" event is raised when the picker pop-up is closing. You can prevent the picker pop-up from closing by setting "e.cancel" to true.

## Closed event

The `Closed` event was raised after the picker pop-up is closed.

                            Closed="picker_Closed"

        }

        private void picker_Opened(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
          // handle the open action
        }

        private void Picker_Closing(object sender, Syncfusion.XForms.Core.CancelEventArgs e)
        {
           // stop the close action by setting the `e.cancel` to true.
        }

        private void picker_Closed(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
           // hit after the picker is closed.
        }
    }

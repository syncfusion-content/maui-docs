# Overview of .NET MAUI Accordion (SfAccordion)

The [.NET MAUI Accordion (SfAccordion)](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-accordion) offers a vertically collapsible panel with stacked headers, allowing the expansion or collapse of one or multiple items simultaneously.

## Key features

* **Expand modes**: Supports various expansion modes, allowing the expansion of single or multiple items.

* **Animation**: Allows the expansion and collapse of Accordion items to be animated. Offers customization options, including adjusting the duration of the animations and modifying the easing style.

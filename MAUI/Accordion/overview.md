# Overview of .NET MAUI Accordion (SfAccordion)

The .NET MAUI Accordion (SfAccordion) offers a vertically collapsible panel with stacked headers, allowing the expansion or collapse of one or multiple items simultaneously.

## Key features

* Expand modes: Supports various expansion modes, allowing the expansion of single or multiple items.

* Animation: Allows the expansion and collapse of Accordion items to be animated. Offers customization options, including adjusting the duration of the animations and modifying the easing style.

# MAUI Popup (SfPopup) Overview

Popup layout allows you to display an alert message with customizable buttons or load any desired view inside a popup. It provides options to fully customize the popup with custom header, body, and footer capabilities, allowing you to display important information precisely how users want to.

## Key features

* `Position` : Display a popup at any desired location on screen.
* `Relative to view` : Display a popup in positions relative to any control on the screen.
* `Full-screen mode` : Display a popup with full-screen width and height to show large content.
* `Auto size` : Automatically adjust the popup’s width and height based on the content loaded in it.
* `Different layouts` : Choose from default layouts, such as one-button layout and two-button layout, to display simple, minimal information.
* `Template support` : Load any view as the header, footer, and content through a template.
* `Modal mode` : Make the popup a modal dialog to prevent interactions with the underlying screen until certain actions are performed

# .NET MAUI Backdrop Page (SfBackdropPage) Overview

The .NET MAUI Backdrop page comprises two surfaces: a back layer and a front layer. The back layer holds actionable content (like navigation or filtration), which is relevant to the front layer.

### Key features

* Allows integration with the NavigationPage and supports seamless navigation and toolbar customizations.
 
* Automatically adjusts the height of the back layer based on its content and provides an option to expand the content to fit the screen.
 
* Supports both curved and flat edge shapes for the front layer with corner radius customization options.
 
* Provides smooth animations for revealing and concealing the back layer's content.
 
* Allows users to customize the icons of the navigation header in both the revealed and closed states separately.

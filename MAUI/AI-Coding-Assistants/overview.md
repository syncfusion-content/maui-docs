# Syncfusion® AI Coding Assistants Overview

The **Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> AI Coding Assistants** are designed to streamline your development workflow when building MAUI applications with Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> components. It uses contextual knowledge of the Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> component library to generate accurate code snippets, configuration examples, and guided explanations—minimizing documentation searches and maximizing productivity.

AI Coding Assistants:

* **The SyncfusionMAUIAssistant MCP Server**
  Processes advanced prompts and returns tailored code suggestions via [MCP-compatible clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients).
* **SyncfusionMAUI GitHub Copilot Extension**
  Augments GitHub Copilot with Syncfusion-specific support for rapid component setup and contextual guidance in the IDE.

## Getting Started

To use the AI Coding Assistants, you need:

* A [Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> user account](https://www.syncfusion.com/account)
* An active Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> license (any of the following):

# .NET MAUI Radial Gauge Overview

The Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> [.NET MAUI Radial Gauge](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-radial-gauge) is a multi-purpose data visualization control that displays numerical values on a circular scale. It has a rich set of features such as axes, ranges, pointers, and annotations that are fully customizable and extendable. Use it to create speedometers, temperature monitors, dashboards, meter gauges, multi-axis clocks, watches, progress indicators, compasses, and more.

## Key Features

* **Axes** - The radial gauge axis is a circular arc in which a set of values are displayed along a linear or custom scale based on design requirements. Axis elements, such as labels, ticks, and the axis line, can be easily customized with built-in properties.
* **Ranges** - Radial range is a visual element that helps quickly visualize where a value falls on the axis.
* **Pointers** - Pointers are used to indicate values on an axis. The radial gauge has three types of pointers: needle pointer, shape pointer, content pointer, and range pointer. All the pointers can be customized as needed.
* **Pointer animation** - Animates the pointer in a visually appealing way when the pointer moves from one value to another.
* **Pointer interaction** - The radial gauge provides an option to drag a pointer from one value to another. It is used to change the value at runtime.
* **Annotations** - Add multiple views such as text and images as annotations to a specific point of interest in a radial gauge.

# Time restriction in .NET MAUI Time Picker (SfTimePicker)

## Minimum Time

The time picker provides an option to restrict the selection of time items by using the [MinimumTime]() property in [SfTimePicker](), and you cannot select the times beyond the minimum time range. The `MinimumTime` value has to be lesser than the `MaximumTime` value.When you set minimum time as timespan only hour and minute gets considered.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight xaml tabtitle="XAML" hl_lines="2" %}

<picker:SfTimePicker x:Name="Picker"
                     MinimumTime="7:40:0">
</picker:SfTimePicker>

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="C#" hl_lines="2" %}

SfTimePicker picker = new SfTimePicker();
picker.MinimumTime = new TimeSpan(7, 40, 0);
this.Content = picker;

{% endhighlight %}  
{% endtabs %}

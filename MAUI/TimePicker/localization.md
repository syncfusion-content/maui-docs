# Localization in .NET MAUI Time Picker (SfTimePicker)

Localization is the process of translating the application resources into different language for the specific cultures. The `SfTimePicker` can be localized by adding `resource` file. 

## Setting CurrentUICulture to the application

Application culture can be changed by setting `CurrentUICulture.` in `App.xaml.cs` file.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="App.xaml.cs" hl_lines="1 2 9 13" %}

using Syncfusion.Maui.Picker;
using System.Globalization;
using System.Resources;

namespace MauiDatePickerDemo;
public partial class App : Application
{
	public App()
	{
		InitializeComponent();
		CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture = new CultureInfo("fr-FR");
      //// ResXPath => Full path of the resx file; For example : //SfTimePickeresources.ResourceManager = new ResourceManager
      // ("MauiTimePickerDemo.Resources.SfTimePicker", Application.Current.GetType().Assembly);

		SfTimePickeresources.ResourceManager = new ResourceManager(ResXPath, Application.Current.GetType().Assembly);
	   MainPage = new MainPage();
	}
}

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

The required `resx` files with `Build Action` as `EmbeddedResource` (File name should contain culture code) into the `Resources` folder.

## Localize application level

To localize the `TimePicker` based on `CurrentUICulture` using `resource` files, follow the below steps.

   1. Create new folder, named as `Resources` in the application.

   2. Add the default resource file of `TimePicker` into `Resources` folder.

   3. Right-click on the `Resources` folder, select `Add` and then `NewItem.`

   4. In Add New Item wizard, select the Resource File option and name the filename as `SfTimePicker.<culture name>.resx.` For example, give the name as `SfTimePicker.fr-FR.resx` for French culture.

   5. The culture name indicates the name of the language and country.

   6. Now, select `Add` option to add the resource file in **Resources** folder.

   7. Add the Name/Value pair in Resource Designer of `SfTimePicker.fr-FR.resx` file and change its corresponding value to corresponding culture.

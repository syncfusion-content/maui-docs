# Overview of .NET MAUI PullToRefresh (SfPullToRefresh)

PullToRefresh is a refresh control that allows you to interact and refresh the view loaded in it. The PullToRefresh control allows you to refresh the view upon performing the pull-to-refresh action. A progress indicator will be shown while starting the pulling. The application will be refreshed once you have pulled down a certain distance and released the touch.

## Use Case Scenarios

[PullToRefresh](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.PullToRefresh.SfPullToRefresh.html) controls are mainly used in applications where users need to refresh the content on demand. The main applications that use the PullToRefresh are listed below:

1. Facebook

# .NET MAUI Navigation Drawer (SfNavigationDrawer) Overview

The .NET MAUI Navigation Drawer is a simpler component for creating a navigation pane in your application. It consists of a content area and a sliding pane that extends from the edge of the page. The pane can be opened either by swiping from the screen edges or programmatically.

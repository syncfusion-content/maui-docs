# .NET MAUI Navigation Drawer (SfNavigationDrawer) Overview

The NavigationDrawer for .NET MAUI is a simpler component to create a navigation pane in the application. It consists of a content area and a sliding pane that slides out from the edge of the page. The pane can be opened by swiping the edges of the screen or programmatically.

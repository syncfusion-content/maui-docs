# .NET MAUI Parallax View (SfParallaxView) Overview

The [SfParallaxView](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.ParallaxView.SfParallaxView.html) for .NET MAUI provides a perfect way for scrolling any control that implements the [IParallaxView](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Core.IParallaxView.html) interface with a background element that translates slower than the foreground element. The [SfParallaxView](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.ParallaxView.SfParallaxView.html) control binds the scroll position of a foreground element (for example, list) to a background element and moves the background element at different speeds.

## Key features

* Customizes the speed of the parallax scroll.
* Supports horizontal and vertical orientation.
* Provides built-in integration with MAUI Scroll View and Syncfusion ListView.
* Bind any control which implements IParallaxView interface.

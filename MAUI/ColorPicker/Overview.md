# .NET MAUI Color Picker (SfColorPicker) Overview

The .NET MAUI Color Picker is a UI component that enables users to select a color from various color palettes or a spectrum. It is particularly useful in design, drawing, or customization scenarios within .NET MAUI applications.

## Key features

* **Custom colors** : Users can add or remove their own custom colors.
* **Manual entry** : Supports direct input of color values in RGB, HSL, and HEX formats.

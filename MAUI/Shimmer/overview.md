# Overview of .NET MAUI Shimmer (SfShimmer)

Syncfusion .NET MAUI Shimmer (SfShimmer) control can increase an application's responsiveness by displaying a shimmer effect while content is loading or being processed in the background.

## Key features

* **Multiple shimmer view types**: The .NET MAUI `SfShimmer` provides seven different view types. By default, the `CirclePersona` view is rendered initially.

* **Multiple shimmer wave directions**: This defines the animation wave direction of the shimmer effect. There are five wave directions available in the `SfShimmer`. By default, the wave direction is set to `Default`, which animates from the top-left to the bottom-right.

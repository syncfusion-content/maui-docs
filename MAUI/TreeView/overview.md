# Overview of .NET MAUI TreeView (SfTreeView)

The Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> [.NET MAUI TreeView](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-treeview) is a data-oriented control that displays the hierarchical data,such as organizational structures and nested connections, within your application. It provides a user-friendly way to interact with complex data structures and navigate through different levels of information by allowing users to expand and collapse nodes to reveal or hide underlying information.

## Key features

 * `Enhanced performance`: Uses an optimized view-reusing strategy.

 * `Bound and unbound modes`: Bind hierarchical data or manually add unbound tree nodes.

 * `Selection`: Select nodes through different selection modes and keyboard navigation.

 * `Item templating`: Customize the appearance of each node.

 * `Expand and collapse nodes`: Easily reveal or hide underlying information.

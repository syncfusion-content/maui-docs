# Localization in .NET MAUI AI AssistView (SfAIAssistView)

`Localization` is the process of translating the application resources into different languages for specific cultures. The [SfAIAssistView](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.AIAssistView.SfAIAssistView.html) can be localized by adding a `resource` file.

## Setting CurrentUICulture to the application

Application culture can be changed by setting the `CurrentUICulture` in the `App.xaml.cs` file.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="App.xaml.cs" hl_lines="1 3 12 13" %}

      using Syncfusion.Maui.AIAssistView;
      using System.Globalization;
      using System.Resources;

      namespace MauiAssistView
      {
         public partial class App : Application
         {
            public App()
            {
                  InitializeComponent();             
                  CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture = new CultureInfo("es");   
                  SfAIAssistViewResources.ResourceManager = new ResourceManager("MauiAssistView.Resources.SfAIAssistView", Application.Current!.GetType().Assembly);
                  MainPage = new MainPage();
            }
         }
      }

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

N> The required `resx` files with `Build Action` as `EmbeddedResource` (File name should contain culture code) into the `Resources` folder.

## Localize application level

To localize the `AI AssistView` based on the `CurrentUICulture` using the `resource` files, follow these steps.

   1. Create a new folder named `Resources` in the application.

   2. Right-click on the `Resources` folder, select `Add`, then click on `NewItem`.

   3. In the Add New Item wizard, select the Resource File option and name the filename as `SfAIAssistView.<culture name>.resx`. For example, give the name as `SfAIAssistView.es.resx` for Spanish culture.

   4. The culture name indicates the name of the language and country.

   5. Now, select `Add` option to add the resource file in the **Resources** folder.

   6. Add the Name or Value pair in the Resource Designer of `SfAIAssistView.es.resx` file and change its corresponding value to corresponding culture.

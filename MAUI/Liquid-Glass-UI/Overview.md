# Liquid Glass UI for .NET MAUI Overview

Syncfusion® provides Liquid Glass visual effect support for all our `.NET MAUI` controls, introducing a modern UI design approach that creates a visually appealing, translucent surface with depth and realism. This feature applies `blurred backgrounds`, `adaptive color tinting`, and `light refraction` to create a modern, translucent design that enhances the overall look and feel of your applications while maintaining readability and accessibility across platforms.

## Key Features

* Applies smooth, real-time blur to background content for depth and clarity.
* Automatically adjusts tint and saturation for light and dark themes.
* Adds subtle distortion near edges and corners for a realistic glass-like appearance.
* Creates glossy reflections that respond to user interaction and motion.

## Supported Platforms

* .NET MAUI (requires .NET 10)
* macOS 26 or higher
* iOS 26 or higher

N> This feature is not applicable for Windows and Android platforms.

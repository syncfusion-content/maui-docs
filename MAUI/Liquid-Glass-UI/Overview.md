# Liquid Glass UI for .NET MAUI Overview

Syncfusion® provides Liquid Glass visual effect support for all our `.NET MAUI` controls, introducing a modern UI design approach that creates a visually appealing, translucent surface with depth and realism. This feature applies `blurred backgrounds`, `adaptive color tinting`, and `light refraction` to create a modern, translucent design that enhances the overall look and feel of your applications while maintaining readability and accessibility across platforms.

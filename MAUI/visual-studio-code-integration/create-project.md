# Creating a Syncfusion .NET MAUI application

Syncfusion offers the .NET MAUI Project Template for building .NET MAUI applications using Syncfusion components in Visual Studio Code. This template includes all the necessary Syncfusion components, NuGet references, namespaces, and code snippets required for developing .NET MAUI applications with Syncfusion. The **.NET MAUI Project Template** comes with a project wizard to streamline the application creation process using Syncfusion components.

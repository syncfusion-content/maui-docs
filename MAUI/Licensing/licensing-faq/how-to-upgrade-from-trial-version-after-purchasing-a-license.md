# How to upgrade from Trial version after purchasing a license?

To upgrade from trial version, there are two possible solutions.

* Uninstall the trial version and install the fully licensed build from the [License & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/downloads) section of our website.  
* If you are using Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> controls from [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=syncfusion), replace the currently used trial license key with a paid license key that can be generated from the [License & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/downloads) section of our website. Refer to [this](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/licensing/how-to-register-in-an-application) topic for more information regarding registering the license in the application.

N> License registration is not required if you reference Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> assemblies from Licensed installer. These licensing changes applicable to all evaluators who refers the Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> assemblies from evaluation installer and those who use Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> NuGet packages from [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/).

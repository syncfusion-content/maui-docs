# Essential<sup>®</sup> UI Kit for .NET MAUI Overview

The [Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> Essential<sup>®</sup> UI Kit for .NET MAUI](https://github.com/syncfusion/essential-ui-kit-for-.net-maui) is a comprehensive collection of user-friendly, extendable, and adaptable XAML pages designed to accelerate the development of .NET MAUI applications. It offers a range of pre-defined, generic screens that can be easily customized to meet your requirements. Currently, the Essential UI Kit includes screens categorized under the following sections:

* Forms
* Catalog
* Detail
* Chat
* Article
* Reviews and Ratings
* Contact Us
* About Us
* Navigation
* Error and Empty
* Transaction
* Bookmark
* History
* Social
* Profile
* Tracking
* Settings
* Notification

The screens are developed using the MVVM pattern, which effectively separates the UI from the business logic, resulting in a clean, professional, and scalable user interface for your .NET MAUI applications. You can download the Essential UI Kit application from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.syncfusion.essentialuikit.maui) and access the complete source code available in [GitHub repository](https://github.com/syncfusion/essential-ui-kit-for-.net-maui)

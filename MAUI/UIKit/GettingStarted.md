# Getting Started with Essential® UI Kit for .NET MAUI

There are two ways for including the UI Kit screens into your application:

1. Using the Visual Studio extension's **Essential® UI Kit for .NET MAUI**.

2. Copying the files from our [GitHub repository](), which is open source.


## Essential® UI Kit for .NET MAUI Extension

This is the simplest way to integrate pre-defined screens into your application. Follow these steps to add screens to your app using our extension:

1. Open Visual Studio.

2. Go to **Extension**, and then click **Manage Extensions** as shown in the following screenshot.

4. Restart the Visual Studio and allow it to complete the installation. 

5. Now, open an existing MAUI application or create a new application as per your requirements.
 
6. Right-click the MAUI [NETStandard] project, and you can see the **Essential® UI Kit for .NET MAUI** option.

N> The **Essential® UI Kit for .NET MAUI** add-in will be shown when the project have the **MAUI** NuGet package as a reference and also, MAUI project should be a NETStandard project.

7. Select the category and pages you need to add in your application. In the following screenshot, the **Login with Social Icon** screen has been selected from the **Forms** category.

## How to Render the Added Page?

In a MAUI demo application, to set the added page as the startup page, you need to define it in the **App.xaml.cs** file. For instance, if you’ve added the **Login with Social Icon Page**, you can set it as the startup page using the following code snippet:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# hl_lines="3" %}

// For NET 8 Use this Below Code Snippet:

MainPage = new LoginWithSocialIcon();

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight hl_lines="3" %}

// For NET 9 Use this Below Code Snippet:

protected override Window CreateWindow(IActivationState? activationState)
{
    return new Window(new LoginWithSocialIcon());
}

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

In real-world applications, you may need to do the following to use these XAML pages:
1. Update the services to fetch data from a remote server or local database.
2. Wire up the navigation and update the business logic in the view models.

# .NET MAUI Linear Gauge (SfLinearGauge) Overview

Syncfusion [.NET MAUI Linear Gauge](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-linear-gauge) is a data visualization control to display data on a linear scale. Use this control to craft high-quality mobile app user interfaces.

## Key Features

* **Orientation** - The Linear Gauge can be set to vertical or horizontal orientation.
* **Scale** - The scale is a set of values that can be plotted. You can customize a scale by changing the thickness and edge styles, and you can also inverse the scale.
* **Labels and Ticks** - The scale elements such as labels, major ticks, and minor ticks can be customized to different styles.
* **Ranges** - A range is a visual element that helps you to quickly visualize where a range falls on the scale track. Multiple ranges with different styles can be added to the Linear Gauge.
* **Pointers** - A pointer is used to indicate a specific value on an scale. The gauge has three types of pointers: shape marker pointer, content marker pointer, and bar pointer. All the pointers can be customized as needed and you can also add multiple pointers in the Linear Gauge.
* **Mirror Gauge** - The Linear Gauge can be mirrored. When the [`IsMirrored`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Gauges.SfLinearGauge.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Gauges_SfLinearGauge_IsMirrored) property is true, all the gauge elements will be rendered in mirror effect. 
* **Animation** - Animate the gauge elements in a visually appealing manner when they are loaded or their values are changed.
* **Interaction** - The shape and content marker pointers in the Linear Gauge can be moved from one value to another by swiping or drag gestures.

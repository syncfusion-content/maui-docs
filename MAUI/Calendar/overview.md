# Overview of .NET MAUI Calendar (SfCalendar)

Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> .NET MAUI Calendar (SfCalendar) is a calendar control that allows users to select a Single date, Multiple dates, or a Range of dates. It provides various view options such as a Month, Year, Decade, and Century, which allow users to quickly navigate to the desired date. It also supports minimum dates, maximum dates, enable past dates, and disabled dates to restrict the date selection.

## Key features

* **Multiple calendar view modes**: For selection and navigation, use Month, Year, Decade, and Century calendar views.

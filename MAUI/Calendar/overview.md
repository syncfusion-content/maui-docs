# Overview of .NET MAUI Calendar (SfCalendar)

Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> .NET MAUI Calendar (SfCalendar) is a calendar control that allows users to select a Single date, Multiple dates, or a Range of dates. It provides various view options such as a Month, Year, Decade, and Century, which allow users to quickly navigate to the desired date. It also supports Minimum dates, Maximum dates, Enable past dates, and Disabled dates to restrict the Date selection.

## Key features

* **Multiple calendar view modes**: For selection and navigation, use Month, Year, Decade, and Century calendar views.

We are pleased to announce that we have updated the versioning system of Essential Studio速 to a semantic format that provides greater clarity and consistency in versioning, making it easier for users to understand the significance of each Syncfusion release.
<br>
<br> The new format consists of three components: Major, Minor, and Patch.
<br>
<br> Format: Major.Minor.Patch
<br> Example: 21.1.35
<br>
<br> We believe that this change will enable our users to track and manage updates to our components effectively. We are excited to see how it enhances their experience.

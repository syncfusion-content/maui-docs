# Overview of .NET MAUI Smart Scheduler (SfSmartScheduler)

The Syncfusion<sup>&reg;</sup> .NET MAUI Smart Scheduler (SfSmartScheduler) combines the power of the Scheduler with AI-driven intent understanding. Users can create, update, delete, and explore appointments using plain language—reducing clicks and turning scheduling into a conversation. It respects current view context, resources, and availability, and can detect conflicts, find free time, and summarize schedules.

## Key features

* **Natural-language CRUD:** Create, update, and delete appointments by typing what you want. The SmartScheduler understands time, date, subject, recurrence, and even resource references without requiring structured forms.

* **Resource-aware booking:** Book rooms, equipment, or people while respecting their availability and the scheduler’s current filters. When a requested resource is unavailable, the control can suggest alternatives or adjacent time slots.

* **Conflict detection:** Instantly detect overlapping appointments for selected dates, ranges, or resources. The smart scheduler can highlight conflicts and propose resolutions (e.g., reschedule, reassign, or extend buffer times)()

* **Smart summarization:** Generate concise summaries for upcoming or selected appointments, helping users understand what’s next at a glance (e.g., “Summarize my meetings tomorrow”).

* **Adaptive assist panel:** The assist view opens in compact or expanded layouts with configurable height and width, providing a comfortable experience on phone, tablet, and desktop.

* **Assist access button:**  The assist button can be enabled or disabled and replaced with a custom data template to match the app’s design.
 
* **Event Support:**  Users can choose whether appointment changes are applied automatically by the Smart Scheduler or handled manually using events.

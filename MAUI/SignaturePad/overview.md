# .NET MAUI SignaturePad (SfSignaturePad) Overview

The .NET MAUI SignaturePad (`SfSignaturePad`) is an interactive UI control, allowing users to capturing smooth and realistic signatures. Also, it allows you to save signatures as images and sync them across devices and documents that need signatures. You can use your finger, pen, or mouse on a tablet, touchscreen, etc., to draw your own signature on this SignaturePad control.

## Key features

* **Signature stroke color customization** - Allows you to set the stroke color for the signatures.
* **Signature stroke thickness customization** - Allows you to set the minimum and maximum stroke thickness for the signatures.
* **Save as image** - Provides option to save the drawn signature as an image. This converted image can be embedded in documents, PDFs, and anything else that supports using images to denote a signature. 
* **More realistic handwritten look and feel** - The unique stroke rendering algorithm draws a signature based on the speed of the drawn gestures along minimum and maximum stroke thicknesses, which brings a more realistic, handwritten look and feel to the signature.

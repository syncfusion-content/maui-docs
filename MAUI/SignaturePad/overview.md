# .NET MAUI SignaturePad (SfSignaturePad) Overview

The .NET MAUI SignaturePad ([`SfSignaturePad`](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-signaturepad)) is an interactive UI control that allows users to capture smooth and realistic signatures. This control also enables saving signatures as images, which can be synchronized across various devices and documents requiring signatures. Users can draw their own signature using a finger, pen, or mouse on tablets, touchscreens, etc., directly within the SignaturePad control.

## Key Features

* **Signature Stroke Color Customization** - Enables customization of the stroke color for signatures.
* **Signature Stroke Thickness Customization** - Allows setting the minimum and maximum stroke thickness for signatures.
* **Save as Image** - Provides options to save the drawn signature as an image. This converted image can then be embedded in documents, PDFs, and various platforms that use images to denote a signature.
* **Realistic Handwritten Look and Feel** - Utilizes a unique stroke rendering algorithm that adapts to the speed of drawn gestures, along with minimum and maximum stroke thickness settings, to deliver a more realistic, handwritten appearance to signatures.

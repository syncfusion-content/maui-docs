# Selection in .NET MAUI Sunburst Chart 

The sunburst chart provides support to select or highlight the segments.

## Type

The SelectionType property allows you to select a segment based on the following categories:
* Child: Highlights the selected segment along with its children in all levels.
* Group: Highlights the entire group of the selected segment in a hierarchy.
* Parent: Highlights the parent of the selected segment in the hierarchy.
* Single: Highlights the selected segment alone.

The following code shows the `Child` selection type.

# Selection in .NET MAUI Sunburst Chart 

The sunburst chart provides ssupports selecting and highlighting segments. Selection is triggered by a tap gesture on a segment, enabling users to interact with hierarchical data.

## Type

The `Type` property in allows you to select a segment based on the following categories:
* Child: Highlights the selected segment along with its children in all levels.
* Group: Highlights the entire group of the selected segment in a hierarchy.
* Parent: Highlights the parent of the selected segment in the hierarchy.
* Single: Highlights the selected segment alone.

The default value of the `Type` property is `Single`.

The following code shows the `Child` selection type.
